                <h2>2009</h2>
                <p class = "info-text">The most recent development in Arnis history is the passing of <a href = "https://lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2009/ra_9850_2009.html">RA 9850</a> or the Arnis Law, which declares Arnis as the National Martial Art and National Sport of the Philippines. The Arnis bill was signed into law on December 11, 2009, with Mr. Richardson C. Gialogo as the writer and one of its main proponents. The passing of the bill is guided by the Philippine Constitution (Article XIV, Section 19), which calls upon the State to; Promote education and encourage sports programs, league competitions, and amateur sports, training for international competitions, to foster self-discipline, teamwork, and excellence for the development of a healthy and alert citizenry..</p>
