                <h2>1873</h2>
                <p class = "info-text">In 1873 the fighting system was renamed "Arnis" derived from the word Arnes which means colorful trapping on defensive armors used on the Moro-Moro plays. Some of the heroes of the Philippine revolution were also practitioners of Arnis namely Andres Bonifacio, the spouses Diego and Gabriela Silang, and the young General Gregorio Del Pilar. The National Hero Jose Rizal was also reported to practice the fighting system. As well as the founder of Aglipayan Church Rev. Gregorio Aglipay was also recorded as a practitioner of the art.<br><br>After hundreds of years with Spanish colonization the Japanese invaders took their place to invade the Philippines during the World War II, again experts of the native fighting arts were called upon to fight for the country's freedom. Kali, Escrima or Arnis whichever term the individual prefer to use was once again employed on the battlefield. It's efficiency was put to a test again but this time against the Japanese invaders.<br><br>The Filipinos fought side by side with the Americans. Natives with skills in the fighting art signed up to be freedom fighters known as "Guerillas". It is also these "Guerillas" who were usually front liners during the encounter and they were usually sent on a commando mission for reconnaissance against the Japanese.</p>
